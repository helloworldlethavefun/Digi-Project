            I recommend python because it has a really good mix of being easy to understand and 
            learn but is also really powerful. I think python is a lot easier to 
            understand because itâ€™s syntax (the punctuation for a programming language) 
            is really easy to understand and remember rather than a language like c which is low level (that is very close to writing machine code and directly control the computer hardware). 
            Python also has a wide range of use cases, for example:
            <ul>
                <li>Data Analysis</li>
                <li>Machine learning and A.I (arificial intelligence)</li>
                <li>Web Content</li>
                <li>Games</li>
                <li>And there are many other uses!</li>
            </ul>
