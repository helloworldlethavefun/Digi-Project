            A programming language is a way that humans can instruct the computer to do things. 
            It is basically a set of instructions. Something to keep in mind is that a computer does
            what you tell it to do, not what you want it to do. 
            There are also many different programming languages that can also be used for specific reasons. Here
            is a list of some of the most commonly known languages:
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Ruby</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>Java (different to javascript)</li>
                <li>And much much more!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Programming languages can be fun and also useful to learn! 
               For example, let’s say you have to rename a large amount of files and you 
               don’t want to do it one by one, go through and rename heaps and 
               heaps of files, coding can solve that! You can write a simple little program 
               (or script, another word for short, runnable program), and automatically do that for you.</p>
